    <description>This application is a small helper app designed to follow the git credentials API as defined by the Git Documentation. This app just uses the existing Windows Credential Store to hold your credentials. You can see the stored credentials by going to Control Panel > User Accounts > Credential Manager and choosing "Windows Credentials". The entries starting "git:" are from git-credential-winstore.</description>
    <summary>Little app for use as a HTTPS Credential Cache helper that uses the Windows Credential Store.</summary>
